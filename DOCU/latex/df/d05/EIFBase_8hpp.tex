\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class provides the interface to classes which estimate the \char`\"{}closeness\char`\"{} of the modeled intensity to the data. As it is pure virtual, one needs at least one implementation to provide an estimator for the analysis. If a new estimator is derived from and fulfills this base-\/class, no change in other modules are necessary to work with the new estimation function.
